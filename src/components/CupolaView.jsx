      info: `
        This breathtaking view shows the Sun rising over Earth from the International Space Station. 
        Astronauts use these observations to study atmospheric phenomena, monitor weather patterns, and observe Earth's curvature. 
        The colors you see are caused by scattering of sunlight in the atmosphere, which helps scientists understand air composition and pollution. 
        Sunrise images also allow researchers to track cloud formations and storm development globally. 
        Studying these images can improve climate modeling and prediction of natural disasters.`

      info: `
        Night-time imagery reveals city lights, auroras, and other features of Earth's surface. 
        These views help scientists monitor human activity patterns, energy consumption, and urbanization. 
        Astronaut observations also provide data on the extent and brightness of auroras, which are critical for studying Earth's magnetosphere. 
        Nighttime images help track events like wildfires, fishing lights, and even migrating animal populations. 
        Overall, these images give a unique perspective to understand human impact and natural phenomena on Earth.`
